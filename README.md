# MCS_SeeingAI
An Xamarin-app using the Microsoft Cognitive Services (Computer Vision). The app uses the following NuGet-dependencies:

* Xamarin.Forms
* Xam.Plugin.Media (for camera access)
* Xam.Plugins.TextToSpeech (for text to audio conversion)
* Plugin.Permissions (for checking the needed permissions)

The idea of the app is based on the [Seeing AI project by microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2mC-NUAmMk).
